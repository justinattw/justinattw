# What happened
- I stayed up late the night earlier, finishing *I Who Have Never Known Men*. Created a Goodreads account and rated it 3/5.
- Took the tube to Mansion House. Started reading Catch 22.
- Probed an SD card from an old digital camera. Found photos from Tibet, 2011. I recall that I found myself in China and Tibet, behind the great firewall when the London riots took place in 2011.
- 1.5 hour walk from St Paul's with Danny around Embankment, Waterloo bridge, oevr South Bank, then back up Millennium bridge.
- Visited Old Sessions House on a hot desking day. Nice interior decor and a rooftop dipping pool.
- Pair programmed with Rick, looking at DataDog and Splunk.
- Met Ishaan, walking from Farringdon to Soho and having dinner at Funky Noodles with Victoria.
- Walked from Soho to Victoria station.

# Meaningful conversations
- Asked Danny to invite me to the stag do. Spoke about taboo workplace words in English, like 'sourpuss'. Also spoke about fitness; Danny told me about *Four Thousand Weeks*, a book on time management. Write up everything you want to do, and learn to prioritise by taking the top 5 things from this list.
- Rick mentioned that his brother has just recently travelled Uzbekistan. The Amu Darya is a vital river along the silk road.
- Spoke at length with Ishaan, but it was the usual idle chat. 

# Lessons learnt and reflections
- DataDog: look at dashboards every now and then.
- DataDog: be proactive in creating your own notebooks. This allows you to look at the impact of a release.
- Fitness: aiming for lower reps and higher weights (to failure) is the best way to build muscle.

# Frustrations and anxieties
- I wish I was more diligent/ clinical with work.

# Word of the day
**Sourpuss**. A habitually gloomy or sullen person; a grouch.
