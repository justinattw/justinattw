# What happened
- Did a strength and conditioning class with Marion and Tom Stone for the road
- Went to David Lloyd gym
- Packed for Samarkand. Switched out my read for the road from *Catch 22* to *W Time of Gifts*, a happy coincidence of a travel book from London to Constantinople; my layover is in Istanbul.
