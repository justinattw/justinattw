# What happened
- I worked from Victoria's until 11:30.
- Completed feedback for a senior engineer at GitHub.
- Went to gym, bumped into Dylan and pumped iron with him.
- A lawyer on LinkedIn contacted me, seeking engineering help on a startup app she has conceived of. We connected and discussed briefly what our expectations are.
- I went over to Victoria's, had a date night with Bunsik and Black Mirror.
